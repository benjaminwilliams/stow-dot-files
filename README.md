# My Dotfiles

## How?

This repo uses GNU stow to symlink the dotfiles to the correct location in the home directory

## Getting started

1. requires `git` and `stow`
1. clone this repo into the home directory (must be home, cant be a subfolder)
1. cd into the repo then create a symlink for the folder by running `stow foo` e.g `stow kitty`
